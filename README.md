# Generative 3D Composition

A generative art project creating unique 3D sculptural compositions with colored acrylic rings, curved connections, and anchor-based structural elements.

## Features

- Seeded random generation for reproducible compositions
- Three-layer depth system (38.1mm spacing)
- Circle packing algorithm with tangency constraints
- Curved arch connections and straight leg supports
- STL export for 3D printing (press 's')
- JSON metadata export (press 'j')
- Regenerate compositions (press spacebar)
